Knackered
================
The Knackered Engine is a security competition scoring engine.

Designed with quick setup in mind, all that is needed is a linux server with LAMP and Python. Tested primarily on Ubuntu 12.04 but should run on just about anything.

Knackered's backend uses checks from the nagios-plugins package. (sudo apt-get install nagios-plugins)

The system is also designed to be easily modifiable. All checks are made from Runner.py, calling scripts in the nagios-plugins directory. 


Installation and Setup
============
Ensure MySQL 5+, Apache2, PHP 5.3+, and nagios-plugins are installed (and, if necessary, running)

Configure the database information at the top of Knackered-Backend/DataAccess.py

If nagios-plugins aren't in /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/, specify the directory at the top of Knackered-Backend/Runner.py

Run Knackered-Backend/main.py and tables will be generated automatically.

From there, use the web interface to configure Knackered-Backend for your competition.
